        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>I currently finished my studies as a Java Developer at STOCKHOLM TECHNICAL INSTITUTE. 
            During my time at STI, I have completed several projects, ranging from software development to hardware
            engineering to web development, which has broadened my toolkit immensely. Within these projects
            I have acted in a leadership role as scrum master, acting close with the product owner to implement their
            needs into the product and further improve on current concerns.</p>

        <h3>Work & Projects</h3>
        <p>I worked for a company called <strong>Sustainit</strong> where i did my internship. I had the chance to work with two projects one of them was
          development of a web app (Dimo) to handle Södertälje's municipality's governing
          documents. Has worked both front and backend and with database management.
          Express.js , Mongo DB , Node , Vue.js
          In the second project response to the company's vision, we created a mobile application (
          MakeAChange)that encourages people to do things that preserve the
          environment while also allowing people to enjoy a healthy life for themselves as
          well as
          the planet we live on</p>
